            <h3>The falling raindrops had a difficult time finding their way to the ground. They were urged forward&mdash;or, down, perhaps&mdash;by something they couldn't see. He told another:<em>why don't you quit going that way? there's nothing telling you where to go, can't you tell?</em> But the others weren't convinced. I wasn't convinced, it felt like I was falling down. Before long, some of the drops started to get cold. Some couldn't move much anymore&mdash;except down, of course. Some couldn't move at all&mdash;except down. This made the descent even more difficult. But only for the other drops.<em>looks like they never had a choice. frozen, just falling without any way to stop themselves. if only i could help. if only they could help themselves.</em>But not everyone felt like that. He felt pity for them, like we did, but for a different reason.

            On the ground, I felt it start to rain.
