            <h3 id="headline">But it is also true that the most optimistic ethics have all begun by emphasizing the element of failure involved in the condition of man; without failure, no ethics; for a being who, from the very start, would be an exact co-incidence with themself, in a perfect plenitude, the notion of having-to-be would have no meaning. One does not offer an ethics to a God.</h3>

He went to school in Boston and currently lives in Seattle. He has a number of interests but only one of them is his job. He recently changed his title from "Software Engineering Student" to "Software Engineer" because that is his new job, though he is still learning.

You can contact him (<a href="mailto:milesmahon@pm.me"><font color="7B99FA">securely!</font></a>) or you can contact a loved one instead. Maybe he will become a loved one of yours. Miles doesn't write poetry but he really enjoyed <a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/three-re-tellings/"><font color="E38ED2">Eve Ewing's</font></a><em><a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1129-electric-arches"><font color="C75696">Electric Arches</font></a></em>and recommends it to everyone he knows. He also likes Hanif Abdurraqib's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMua0a7zAao"><font color="D00000">performances</font></a> of his poetry. He thinks about<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZxQFhBSuw"><font color="9870FC"> this one</font></a> when he's claustrophobic on airplanes.</h3>
